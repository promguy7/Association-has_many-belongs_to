3.rails generate controller Comments
4.Modify the migrations and models
5.Run migrations
6.Use validations

https://robots.thoughtbot.com/referential-integrity-with-foreign-keys

why to write foreign_key parameter in migration if we use dependent: :destroy

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
end


dependent: :destroy save us here? Well, delete_all doesnâ€™t instantiate the objects it is deleting and thus does not fire any after_destroy callbacks. The dependent options work via that callback.

ADDED TO MIGRATION:
 t.references :post, index: true, foreign_key:true (oprtional if .destroy is used)
Quering

@post=Post.find_or_create_by(name: 'Andy')
@comment=@post.comments.find_or_create_by(post_id: '1')
 @comment.destroy          DELETE THE COMMENT OF THE POST
@post.delete                      DELETE THE POST AND THE COMMENTS OF THE POSTS


dependent: :destroy if this is not mentioned then 

@post.delete                      DELETE THE COMMENTS OF THE POSTS BUT NOT THE POST

QUESTION
Do we need to add belongs_to and has_many for the same association ??? YES


Adding one more model to Post and Comments
rails generate model Tag urls:string comment:references

QUERIES
@post=Post.find(2)
@comments=@post.comments.find_or_create_by(commenter: 'Andycomment')
@comments.tags.find_or_create_by(urls: 'http://www.andy2.com')
irb(main):058:0> Post.find(2).comments[0].tags[0]

  Post Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."id" = ? LIMIT 1  [["id", 2]]
  Comment Load (1.0ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments"  WHERE "comments"."post_id" = ?  [["post_id", 2]]
  Tag Load (0.0ms)  SELECT "tags".* FROM "tags"  WHERE "tags"."comment_id" = ?  [["comment_id", 2]]
=> #<Tag id: 1, urls: "http://andy.com", comment_id: 2, created_at: "2015-06-27 06:33:41", updated_at: "2015-06-27 06:33:41">

1.irb(main):022:0> @post.comments

2.NoMethodError: undefined method `comments' for #<Post::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x4cf9260>
